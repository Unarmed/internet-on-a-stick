# Internet on a stick

Internet on a stick, or InternetOnnaStick as it is commonly called, is a small program that is used to generate marokv chains of words. These markov chains can then be used to generate new sentences, often with strange results.

## Interface

InternetOnnaStick's current incarnation is a small HTTP server where users can POST bodies of text for parsing and GET new sentences back out. Happy garbling!
